My name is Marouane Benchiekh or Mabenchi a fellow learner interested in Cyber Security realm. Trying to share my learning journey and any write-ups i wrote along the way. Iâ€™m from Morocco, currently studying at 1337.

I had been active on TryHackme platform which helped me develop my skills on diffrent fields, pushing myself after 4 months to finally rank from the top 1%.

Iâ€™m more interested in Active Directory subjects then Web Application pentesting.

My first steps into IT fields was as a Web Developer which gave me the perspective that helped me a lot delving into this world of Cyber Security.
